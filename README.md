**Credit Card Fraud Detection**

This project aims to build a robust model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing detailed information about such transactions. The primary objective is to accurately classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. To achieve this, the project explores and experiments with various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
